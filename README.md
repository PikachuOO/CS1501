Introduction

So I am aware that there is a ride range of CS experience in the room. Some of you may already be web dev pro's and on the other hand, I am suspect some of you to be thinking "What the hell are you talking about? Is that mustard on your collar?".  This course is not meant to be a burden on you and on the contrary is supposed to be beneficial to you and your career.  If you are ever struggling, please feel free to contact me to ask questions. I will also link to a lot of resources related to the material that will be very helpful if something is unclear. Thanks for taking the class, I'm looking forward to the rest of the semester!
