#Javascript

####What is Javascript
* JavaScript is interpreted
* JavaScript is asynchronous
* JavaScript is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based">Prototype-based</a> scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions
* JavaScript was formalized in the EMCAScript language which was developed by Netscape
	* ActionScript (commonly used in Adobe Flash) is also an ancestor of EMCAScript and thus shares a lot of simlarities with JavaScript
* JavaScript is very liberal in what it allows a programmer to do. This is both good and bad
	* **Bad**: It makes finding errors in your code harder because the language does not point them out to you as well as a stricter language
	* **Good**: It gives you room to try some techniques that are not possible in a stricter language	

####Why the name JavaScript
* Despite the name, JavaScript has very little to do with Java
* The name, JavaScript, was inspired by marketing considerations because at the time of its inception in 1995, Java was rapidly gaining popularity.
* Someone at netscape thought it would be a good idea to ride the Java train despite the small similarities between the two languages

####Introduction to the JavaScript Language
* Numbers
	* Numbers in JS are 64 bits
		* 1 bit is used to hold the sign
		* 11 bits are used to store the fractional part
		* This leaves 52 bits to hold the whole number
		* This means any number < 2^52 can safely be stored in a JS number
	* Operations on Numbers
		* Follow the order of operations when there are no parens (PEMDAS)
* Strings
	* "A string of characters"
	* Use \ to escape characters within quotes
		* "This is "quoted"": will not do as you expect
		* "This is \"quoted\"" will
	* \n: newline character. To print \n you need to escape it:
		* "A newline character is written like \"\\n\"."
	* strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted but the '+' operator will concatenate them
* typeof
	* Prints a string representing the type of the operand passed to it.
	* e.g. typeof 4.5 = "number"
* booleans
	* true and false
	* "Aardvark" < "Zoroaster" = true
		* comparison of strings is more or less alphanumericâ€¦ Uppercase characters are always less than Lowercase characters
		* Why?
			* Unicode values
	* and: &&
	* or: ||
	* not: !
* Variables
	* Things used to catch and hold values
		* var caught = 5*5;
	* var is used to create a new variable
	* variables cannot include spaces, cannot start with a digit, and can include '$' and '_'
	* generally JS coders camelCase their variables
	* The collection of variables and their values at any given time is called the environment. When a program starts up, the environment is not empty.
		* e.g. When your browser loads a page, it creates a new environment and attaches the standard value to it
* Interacting with your browser's console
	* Type 'alert("Hello World!");' into your browsers console
	* Does it work if you forget the semicolon?
	* Eloquent JavaScript suggests using 'print' to print to the console. Does this work in our browser?
		* How should we print to the console?
	* confirm: allows us to ask yes/no in alert boxes
* Loops:
	
	    * while:
	    	var currentNumber = 0;
	    	while(currentNumber <=12){
	  	  		console.log(currentNumber);
	    		currentNumber = currentNumber + 2;
	    	}
	    * for:
	    	for(var number = 0; number <=12; number = number+2)
	    		console.log(number)
* Control Flow
	* if, else if, else: work like they do in Java or C++
* Truth Values:
	* JS has strange comparison rules for values of different types:
		* false == 0: true
		* "" == 0: true
		* "5" == 5: true
		* null == undefined
	* Generally what JS tries to do is to convert one the values to the type of the other.
	* Falsy values: 0, "", null, undefined, and false
	* Use === and !== when you do not want any automatic type conversion. This checks if the two values are exactly equal
		* null === undefined: false
		* false === 0: false
		* "" === 0: false
		* "5" === 5: false
* Implicit type conversion
	* null + "ify": "nullify"
		* adding a non-string to a string will convert the non-string into a string and then concat.
	* "5" * 5: multiplying a string by a number will try to convert the string into a number first
